MACD Tracker

MACD Tracker is a program that tracks and calculates the MACD indicator of
  stocks and gives recommended "buy" and "sell" signals accordingly. MACD
  Tracker is a proof-of-concept application and not intended as a professional
  level market prediction application. Use MACD Tracker at your own discretion.

Installation:
  To run MACD Tracker, download "MACD Tracker.jar" to a folder, then
  run "MACD Tracker.jar"

  MACD Tracker requires Java and an internet connection to run.

Troubleshooting:
  If the program keeps crashing or freezing, delete trackedAssets.txt and restart
  the program.
  
  If you are unable to load an asset, please double check its stock code and
  code formatting at The Wall Street Journal (quotes.wsj.com).

Buy and Sell signals made by this program are purely recommendations based 
  off of the MACD indicator. No program can with 100% certainty predict
  the future of the stock market. Please invest with caution.
